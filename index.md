I am a fifth-year PhD student from Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Univerity of Michigan, supervised by <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~necmiye/index.html">Prof. Necmiye Ozay</a>. 
 Anticipating graduation in December of this year, I am currently exploring opportunities for research positions, both in postdoctoral roles and within the industry, with a planned start date in 2024.
